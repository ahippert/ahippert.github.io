As part of the computer science department, I have taught during my Ph.D several courses, mainly lab sessions and tutorials:

`Introduction to algorithmics and programming` (1st year students)
<br/>
Tutorials sessions on programming basics. Python was used in lab sessions. Here is an <a href="ahippert.github.io/pdfs/rappel_python.pdf" target="_blank">Python memo example</a> given to students.

`Object oriented programming with Python` (3rd year students)
<br/>
Lab sessions: supervision of group projects extending to several sessions (example: building a house in 3D, Minesweeper video game, Roof temperature monitoring system, etc.).

`Introduction to signal processing` (3rd year), lectures by [Philippe Bolon](https://www.univ-smb.fr/listic/presentation/membres/enseignants-chercheurs/philippe-bolon/).
<br/>
In this course, I conducted lab sessions on Signal propagation, Spectral analysis and Digital filtering.

`Random signal processing` (4th year), lectures by [Guillaume Ginolhac](https://www.univ-smb.fr/listic/presentation/membres/enseignants-chercheurs/guillaume-ginolhac/).
<br/>
I supervised three lab sessions on Autocorrelation functions, Spectral analysis and Adaptive filtering.

`Image processing` (4th year), lectures by [Yajing Yan](https://www.univ-smb.fr/listic/pages-en/yajing-yan-en/)
<br/>
Lab sessions: Image filtering and 2D correlation with an application to glacier displacement estimation with radar satellite images.
<br/>
Tutorial: Image correlation.
