## Short bio (<a href="ahippert.github.io/pdfs/curriculum.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a>)

I am a post-doc at [L2S](https://l2s.centralesupelec.fr/) working with [Florent Bouchard](https://sites.google.com/view/florentbouchard/home) and [Nabil El Korso](https://sites.google.com/site/nabkorso/) (LEME, Université Paris Nanterre). I am interested in the analysis of incomplete data in various applications, such as remote sensing data or EEG data. My research focuses on two kind of approaches to deal with missing data : predictive and parametric approaches. In the former, I try to use EOF analysis and EM algorithm to iteratively predict missing values. In the latter, we try to estimate statistical parameters (mean, covariance) using the EM algorithm from incomplete data.

## Teaching
### Polytech Annecy-Chambéry (engineering school), 2017 - 2020
As part of the computer science department, I have taught during my PhD several courses, mainly lab sessions and tutorials:
- Introduction to algorithmics and programming (1st year students)
Tutorials sessions on the basics of programming. Python was used in lab sessions. Here is an <a href="ahippert.github.io/pdfs/rappel_python.pdf" target="_blank">Python memo example</a> given to students.
- Object oriented programming with Python (3rd year students)
Lab sessions: supervision of group projects extending to several sessions (example: building a house in 3D, Minesweeper video game, Roof temperature monitoring system, etc.).
- Introduction to signal processing (3rd year)
In this course, I conducted lab sessions on Signal propagation, Spectral analysis and Digital filtering.
- Random signal processing (4th year), lectures by [Guillaume Ginolhac](https://www.univ-smb.fr/listic/presentation/membres/enseignants-chercheurs/guillaume-ginolhac/).
I supervised three lab sessions on Autocorrelation functions, Spectral analysis and Adaptive filtering.
- Image processing (4th year), lectures by [Yajing Yan](https://www.univ-smb.fr/listic/pages-en/yajing-yan-en/)
Lab sessions: Image filtering and 2D correlation with an application to glacier displacement estimation with radar satellite images.
<br/>
Tutorial: Image correlation.
